                    1 Italian loaf, french loaf, or baguette<br>
                    ▢1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing<br>
                    ▢½ teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning<br>
                    ▢1 garlic clove, peeled and cut in half<br>
                    ▢2 pounds roma tomatoes, about 10<br>
                    ▢¼ cup white onion, finely minced<br>
                    ▢¼ cup thinly sliced basil leaves<br>
                    ▢2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar<br>
                    ▢1 teaspoon finely minced garlic<br>
                    ▢¼ teaspoon black pepper<br></p>
                <p class="title"> Instructions: <br> 1. Set the oven rack to the middle position. Preheat to 450ºF (232ºC). <br>
                    2. Cut the bread on a slight bias into ½-inch thick slices or ¾-inch for thicker pieces. There should be between 12 to 24 slices depending on the thickness and length of the loaf.<br>
                   3. Lightly brush olive oil on both sides of the bread. Sprinkle salt on both sides.<br>
                    4. Bake until the surface is lightly browned, about 5 minutes per side. You still want a soft chew in the center of the bread and not be completely dried out. Transfer toasted bread to a wire rack.<br>
                    5. While the bread is still warm, rub the cut-side of garlic on both sides of the bread for extra flavor.<br>
                    6. Cut the tomatoes lengthwise into quarters, removing the core and seeds. Chop the tomatoes into ¼-inch dice. There should be about 4 cups of diced tomatoes. Transfer to a medium bowl.<br>
                    7. To the bowl of tomatoes, add the minced onions, basil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, ½ teaspoon salt, and black pepper. Stir to combine.<br>
                    8. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the mixture, stir to combine. Taste and season with salt and pepper as desired.<br>
                    9. Add some of the tomato mixture on top of the toasted bread slices and serve immediately.<br></p>

                   <p class="title"> Chocolate was first seen in bar form around 1910. Dark chocolate is made from the roasted beans of the cacao tree and has many health benefits. From improving bad cholesterol to lowering blood pressure, helping to reduce stress and improving vision, it’s definitely worth eating a square or two a day. A study by Harvard also found that drinking two cups of hot chocolate a day prevented memory decline. Drink up!</p>

                   <p class="title">Raspberries are a member of the rose family. As are cherries, apricots, plums, pears, apples, quinces, peaches, strawberries, and blackberries. These types of fruits typically have flowers with five equal petals arranged around a central core. Unlike many other fruits, once picked, unripe raspberries do not ripen.</p>
